# BlackSwan Android Test app

Show us what you can do and how clean your code is!

Write an app that loads the most popular movies from theMovieDb.com and shows them. You can use the given basic app skeleton, but please rename the package from com.greenfox.androidtest to com.*yourname*.androidtest. You can modify the existing code, it is for your help. 

**The Moviedb.org is an online database that lets you: browse and rate movies, TV shows and people.

### Submission notes

Code **MUST** be submitted through any distributed version control system.

**Any other way of code submission will be an automatic failure. Eg. zip/rar or similar** 
  
Create a public Git repository for free on [Github](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) and provide us with the link.

### Task:

Create app that will:

* on load fetch the most popular movies and display it in a RecyclerView
* open a detail page if the user clicks on a movie

For image loading, use Picasso or Glide. 
The minSDKVersion should be 19.

For plus points:

* Animations (Tip: https://github.com/lgvalle/Material-Animations)
* Search functionality on list page
* CollapsingToolbar on detail page (https://antonioleiva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/collapsing-toolbar-layout.gif)
* No internet case handling

Tips!
Weâ€™re looking for:
- Clean code
