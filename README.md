# BlackSwan Android Test app

Show us what you can do and how clean your code is!

Write an app that loads the most popular movies from theMovieDb.com and shows them. 

The Moviedb.org is an online database that lets you: browse and rate movies, TV shows and people.

### Submission notes

Code **MUST** be submitted through any distributed version control system.

**Any other way of code submission will be an automatic failure. Eg. zip/rar or similar** 
  
Create a public Git repository for free on [Github](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) and provide us with the link.

### Task:

Create app that will:
 - on load fetch the most popular movies and display it in a RecyclerView
 - open a detail page if the user clicks on a movie

For plus points:
 - Animations (Tip: https://github.com/lgvalle/Material-Animations)
 - Search functionality on list page
 - CollapsingToolbar on detail page (https://antonioleiva.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/collapsing-toolbar-layout.gif)
 - No internet case error handling

Tips!
We’re looking for:
- Clean code
- UX/Design understanding
